# pharmacy-system
This project simulates a pharmacy management portal where Admins can manage medicines, stock, and prescriptions, while Clients (customers/patients) can search medicines, place orders, and view purchase history. The project will be menu-driven, CLI-based in Python, and use MySQL Database for storage with full CRUD functionality.
